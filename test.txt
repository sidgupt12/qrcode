Hello, My name is Siddhant Gupta. 
This is a pretty basic project because I was bored. 
This project will turn any text into a QR code by
using the go-qrcode library by Skip2 for
generating QR codes.

I'll leave it here, but I do intend to take
this project a bit further by building it into
a full-fledged web application with a frontend 
that allows users to create personal custom QR codes for their links.
